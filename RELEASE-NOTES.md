## Master

### Breaking changes

*None yet*

### New features

* Added CVars to control Lidgren's <abbr title="Maximum Transmission Unit">MTU</abbr> parameters:
  * `net.mtu`
  * `net.mtu_expand`
  * `net.mtu_expand_frequency`
  * `net.mtu_expand_fail_attempts`

### Bugfixes

*None yet*

### Other

* Changed Lidgren to be compiled against `net6.0`. This unlocks `Half` read/write methods.
* Lidgren has been updated to [0.2.2](https://github.com/space-wizards/SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network/blob/v0.2.2/RELEASE-NOTES.md). Not all the changes since 0.1.0 are new here, since this is the first version where we're properly tracking this in release notes.
* Robust.Client now uses our own [NFluidsynth](https://github.com/space-wizards/SpaceWizards.NFluidsynth) [nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SpaceWizards.NFluidsynth).

### Internal

* Renamed Lidgren's assembly to `SpaceWizards.Lidgren.Network`.
* Rogue `obj/` folders inside Lidgren no longer break the build.
* Renamed NFluidsynth's assembly to `SpaceWizards.NFluidsynth`
