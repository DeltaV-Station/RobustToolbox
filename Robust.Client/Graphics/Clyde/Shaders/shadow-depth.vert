// The assumption here is that the shadow sampling must be reduced.
// The original cardinal-direction mapper as written by PJB used 4 separate views.
// As such, it's still an increase in performance to only render 2 views.
// And as such, a line can be split across the 2 views.

varying vec2 fragAngle;
