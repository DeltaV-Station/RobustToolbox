     # Super Map Pausing World

     ## Design
     **Add a pause flag to components (Component.Paused)**

     When an entity is "Paused", this is a flag to prevent the entity from showing up in EntityQueries.
     The idea is that the entity won't "react" to simulation events or be processed by systems, effectively freezing time for them.
     This can be useful for a mapping mode where entities are modified only by direct placement and editor/VV manipulation.

     This should only be internal settable by the engine, calling a special MapManager.PauseMap()
     *Any* time the component's MapId gets changed, this has to be synchronized
     Probably check this with the parent/creation functions
     When MapManager.PauseMap() is called, traverse the entire scene tree of a map, calculate & set the paused flag for each comp

     Add a way to poll paused state on ComponentManager, maybe a way to get the MetaComponent struct?
     Should *GetComponent() also return paused status?

     **Add a pause Override flag on entities (MetaDataComponent.PauseOverride)**

     The override flag is required for special entities like the client observer, which need to still be processed on a paused map for movement.
     This would actually only used by a special non-pausable mapping ghost the client should move around with
     This flag would only have to be polled when writing to the Paused flag.


     ## Details
     pausing a map is a concept outside of the simulation, the state of being paused does not have to be serialized
     pausing is on a per-map basis
     GameTime still passes while entities are Paused, this has nothing to do with server pausing.
     so we want to have a collab of admins setting up a pre-init map while another map has the game running
     so even for in-round gag map collab you need per-map pausing
     we can agree pausing on a per-grid or per-entity basis isn't actually a requirement

     ## Implementation
     components can check their entity for paused state (Entity.Paused -> Map.Paused)
     components have a helper property to check their owner's paused state (Component.Paused -> Entity.Paused)
     Systems can check paused state through the components

     put comp.Deleted and comp.Paused as a val tuple in the component manager so you don't have to deref the entity or component object to poll them
     like Dictionary<EntityUid, (Deleted, Paused, Component)> _entTraitDict
     so you don't have to do component.Owner.Paused every time you access a component
     then pausing an entity would set the Paused flag for all of the components
     because changing paused state happens a lot less than getting components in EntityQueries 
     there is 0 reason to deref the component object if it is paused or deleted
     this gives the ability for anything accessing a component (EventBus, EntityQuery) to early exit without the Component deref
     the downside is that it increases the size of the _entTraitDict entries, leading to more memory access
     this can be mitigated by using a modern CPU that understands array enumeration
     and lets face it, whatever the ECS system is doing is going to eclipse the speed savings
     it is critical that the struct stays <= 16 bytes, also check out the new C# 10/.net 6 dict improvements for accessing structs

     the paused/deleted could be turned into bitflags if there are other things to check
     like we could pack the mapid into the value if that was useful
    
     ## MapEditor
     This system is used by MapInit
     by definition "Paused" is a pre-init map (you sure?)
